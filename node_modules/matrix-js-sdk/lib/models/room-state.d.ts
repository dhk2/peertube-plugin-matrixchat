     * There are two types of room member associated with a state event:
     * normal member objects (accessed via getMember/getMembers) which mutate
     * with the state to represent the current state of that room/user, e.g.
     * the object returned by `getMember('@bob:example.com')` will mutate to
     * get a different display name if Bob later changes his display name
     * in the room.
     * There are also 'sentinel' members (accessed via getSentinelMember).
     * These also represent the state of room members at the point in time
     * represented by the RoomState object, but unlike objects from getMember,
     * sentinel objects will always represent the room state as at the time
     * getSentinelMember was called, so if Bob subsequently changes his display
     * name, a room member object previously acquired with getSentinelMember
     * will still have his old display name. Calling getSentinelMember again
     * after the display name change will return a new RoomMember object
     * with Bob's new display name.

     * @param roomId - Optional. The ID of the room which has this state.

     * and shared when the room state is cloned for the new timeline.
     * This should only be passed from clone.
