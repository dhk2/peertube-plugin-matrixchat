     *
     * <li>`null -> ERROR` : Occurs when the initial sync failed first time.
     *
     * <li>`ERROR -> PREPARED` : Occurs when the initial sync succeeds
     * after previously failing.
     *
     * <li>`PREPARED -> SYNCING` : Occurs immediately after transitioning
     * to PREPARED. Starts listening for live updates rather than catching up.
     *
     * <li>`SYNCING -> RECONNECTING` : Occurs when the live update fails.
     *
     * <li>`RECONNECTING -> RECONNECTING` : Can occur if the update calls
     * continue to fail, but the keepalive calls (to /versions) succeed.
     *
     * <li>`RECONNECTING -> ERROR` : Occurs when the keepalive call also fails
     *
     * <li>`ERROR -> SYNCING` : Occurs when the client has performed a
     * live update after having previously failed.
     *
     * <li>`ERROR -> ERROR` : Occurs when the client has failed to keepalive
     * for a second time or more.</li>
     *
     * <li>`SYNCING -> SYNCING` : Occurs when the client has performed a live
     * update. This is called <i>after</i> processing.</li>
     *
